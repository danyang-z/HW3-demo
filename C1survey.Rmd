## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# 2. Determine: a. the number of observations (i.e. the number of people who filled out the survey) and b. the number of variables in the dataframe.

#5. a. Using code, check the bday and bmonth variables for any unusual or missing values. If you find any, b. describe what you will do with the unusual values in a comment before or immediately following the code that does it, and c. after you have cleaned up any unusual values, find the median bday and month. *Note: please make sure that your bday and month variables are numeric before doing statistics

```{r}
# Load the dataset
# Convert 'bday' to numeric after coercing to character to avoid unexpected NA introduction
C1survey$bday_numeric <- as.numeric(as.character(C1survey$bday))
# Convert 'bmonth' to numeric after coercing to character for the same reason
C1survey$bmonth_numeric <- as.numeric(as.character(C1survey$bmonth))
# Check for and impute missing values in the numeric birthday and birth month data
# Missing values are imputed using the median of available values, excluding NAs

# Replace NA in 'bday_numeric' with the median of the column
C1survey$bday_numeric[is.na(C1survey$bday_numeric)] <- median(C1survey$bday_numeric, na.rm = TRUE)
# Replace NA in 'bmonth_numeric' with the median of the column
C1survey$bmonth_numeric[is.na(C1survey$bmonth_numeric)] <- median(C1survey$bmonth_numeric, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate and display the median birthday and birth month to verify the imputation and conversion
median_bday <- median(C1survey$bday_numeric, na.rm = TRUE)
median_bmonth <- median(C1survey$bmonth_numeric, na.rm = TRUE)
# Output the calculated median values for birthday and birth month
cat("Median Birthday (day):", median_bday, "\n")

#6. a. Create a new variable called bseason that gives the season according to Northern Meteorological season in which respondents were born (winter = 12/1 to 2/29, spring = 3/1 to 5/31, summer = 6/1 to 8/31, fall = 9/1 to 11/30). b. Using the table function, print a table of Seasons in the columns and bmonths in the rows that allows you to check that the coding is correct c. Sum the columns using the addmargins function to answer the question of how many classmates were born in each season? Include your answer in the code.
```{r}
# a.
# using dplyr
C1survey <- C1survey %>%
  mutate(bseason=case_when(bmonth %in% c(12,1,2) ~"Winter",
                           bmonth %in% c(3,4,5) ~"Spring",

                           bmonth %in% c(9,10,11) ~"Fall"))
table(C1survey$bmonth, C1survey$bseason) # check variable

C1survey$bseason_f<-factor(C1survey$bseason, levels=c("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall"))


# b. 
table(C1survey$bmonth, C1survey$bseason)
table(C1survey$bmonth, C1survey$bseason_f)

tab<-addmargins(table(C1survey$bmonth, C1survey$bseason, useNA = "always"), 1)

# Births by season: Fall = 4 Winter = 9 Spring = 8 Summer = 8
```
#7. Pick your favorite variable or variables to analyze, come up with a question you want to answer with that variable or variables, generate the code, and provide an answer to your question. Describe what you did using comments (i.e. #’s).

```{r}
